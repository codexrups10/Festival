It is observed as a holiday in some countries by patients, beneficiaries of the healthcare industry, and healthcare organizations.
Throughout India, Doctorâ€™s Day is observed on July 1 in honor of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was a legendary physician and West Bengalâ€™s second Chief Minister. He was born in Patna in 1882 and was the eldest of five siblings. Dr. Roy enrolled in the Calcutta Medical College in 1901 before leaving India for further studies after completing his medical studies in India.</font> </b> </td>

<th colspan="10"> <font size = "4">Dr. Roy even became close with Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle at one point in his life. There is a well-known story about how he had traveled to see Gandhi while he was fasting. He refused to take medicine because it was not manufactured in India. Upon hearing Gandhi refuse treatment in solidarity with his people, Dr. Roy responded and said that he was to treat someone who had represented his countryâ€™s 400 million people so fiercely. Gandhi then took medicine and continued his fight for the greater good.
One of the things Dr. Roy was dedicated to was providing affordable healthcare to all people of India. In fact, he was instrumental in establishing several facilities in Kolkata, including the Jadavpur TB Hospital, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital, Victoria Institution, and Chittaranjan Cancer Hospital. </th>
