The date was chosen as the Indian National Congress proclaimed Purna Swaraj on this day in 1930.Republic Day is commonly associated with parades, political speeches, cultural events and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of India. </font> </b> </td>

<th colspan="10"> <font size = "4"> India achieved independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the success of the Indian independence movement <br>which was led by Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. This was enacted through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an act of the<br> Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of the British Commonwealth. <br>India became a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. Without a standalone <br>constitution, its laws were based on the existent Government of India Act 1935 and governed by the Constituent Assembly of India. </th>
